Using the raw data of Heart failure clinical records Data Set that is available at UCI Machine Learning Repository: Heart failure clinical records Data Set(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records), the project focuses on following:

Using RNN and CNN, develop binary classification models (based on RNN and CNN). You need to divide the data in to training and testing data sets, develop each model, and then test your model. Use the same training dataset for developing the RNN and CNN models.

Performing K-means and SOM clustering for all of the dataset.

Showing the confusion matrix for all models and comparing them
